## Migrate Deprecated Effects
Deprecated change state tags can be auto migrated for a campaign with the Effects Migrator. A popup box will appear when the table is started such as below.
![](.resources/migrate.png)

<u>It is highly recommended the campaign is backed up before performing migration.</u>

Preview will produce a story entry of the migration changes without writing those changes to the database. Review these changes prior to migration. Some changes may be suggested to effects that do not change state and those changes are likely cleanup of extra whitespace or ;

<img src=".resources/migrate_preview.png"  width="50%" height="90%">

If the suggested changes are acceptable, use Migrate to migrate effects to the new change state cycyler. This will also create a story entry detailing the changes made to the database. You may want to delete these story entries after the migration, especially if you are creating a module for distribution.

You can also bring up the migrate effects popup with the slash command: **/migrate_effects**
## Options

| Name| Default | Options | Notes | Ruleset|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Allow Duplicate Effects| on| off/on| When off, will not allow duplicate effects (same name, duration, actor who applied the effect) on an Actor| 5E|
|Consider Duplicate Duration| off| off/on| When on, considers Concentration duration when determining if previous concentration effects should expire| 5E|
|Deprecate Change State Tags| off| off/on| When on, TURNAS, TURNDS, TURNRS, TURNAE, TURNDE, TURNRE, STURNRS, STURNRE will no longer process and there is a performance increase on change of turn||
|Experimental: Autoparse NPC Powers| off| off/on| When on, will autoparse powers and automatically create effects for: DMGOE, SDMGOS, SDMGEOE, SAVES, SAVEE| 5E|
|Restrict Concentration| off| off/on| When on, expires any previous spells with concentration (C) when a new concentration spell is cast| 5E|
|TempHP Reduction is Damage| on| off/on| For purposes of determining if something should happen if an actor takes damage. When off, if an actor takes damage that reduces their Temp HP only and NOT their HP (takes wounds), that reduction is not considered damage||
### Add Effect on Damage Modifiers

Effects can be automatically added to the source or the target on the damage by either the source of the damage or the target of the damage. For this to work we need two different effects.  Example:

* Shadow; SDMGADDT: Strength Drain

The Shadow has strength drain so we put the above effect on the shadow. When the shadow deals damage, it will apply the effect "Strength Drain" to the target of the damage. The effect "Strength Drain" needs to be an effect listed in our custom effects list or conditions table. The effect looks like this:

* Strength Drain; STR: -1d4; STACK; RESTL
